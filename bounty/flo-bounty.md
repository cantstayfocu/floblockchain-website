# Overview

## FLO Bounty system

The bounty system of the FLO community is simple. We list the proposal's name, description, condition to release the payment, and a set of addresses. Donations can go directly to the addresses and it accumulates. The amount in the addresses is the payment at the time of release.

After 1 year, if nobody claims the payment, the amount in the addresses will go to the Big Mac treasury addresses.
